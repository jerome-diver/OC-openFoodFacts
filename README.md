## Trello board

I use [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/2EKEGLIA/oc-python-projet-5-openfoodfacts) to manage agile Doc Driven Development technic

## OpenClassRooms Python Path

This is an OpenClassRooms [Python Path project number 5](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/projects/157/assignment)

## Langage used

Python-3.7.17 used

## Database used

I'm sorry, i had to use MySQL or MariaDB, so i did it with MariaDB.
So you should install this database server and why not create a
dedicated admin user for the application ?
database name will be "openfoodfacts_substitutes"

## Libraries dependancies

- PyQt5
- pymysql
- os
- sys
- [openfoodfacts](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-python)

look at requirements.tx file, i used virtualenv (but you can use pyenv or uv or poetry what ever you like) to install virtual environment with Python-3.7.17

## How to install

- clone the project with git
- move inside the project directory
- install required libraries (with your favorite tool)
- install Qt5 OS libraries (it depends of your OS for the specific names, but install there devel packages as well)
- install a MariaDB server and apply to create a administrator user
- start the server MariaDB on your system, initialize it then create you administrator user with grant all privileges
- create an environment variable for GRANT administrator user of MariaDB named GRANT_MARIADB_OFF_USER
- create an environment variable for GRANT Administrator password named GRANT_MARIADB_OFF_PASSWD

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jerome-diver/OC-openFoodFacts
cd OC-openFoodFacts
pip install -r requirements.txt
export GRANT_MARIADB_OFF_USER="<my_admin_name>"
export GRANT_MARIADB_OFF_PASSWD="<my_admin_password>"
```

### On Fedora OS

```bash
sudo dnf install qt5-qtbase qt5-qtbase-devel
sudo dnf install mariadb-server
```

(a good idea is to export theses variables inside your shell user source
script: ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc or whatever you use to be able to no have to
do that each time you want to start the application)

```bash
vim ~/.zshrc
[G o]
export GRANT_MARIADB_OFF_USER="my_admin"
export GRANT_MARIADB_OFF_PASSWD="my_admin_passord"
[ESC :wq]
```

(and an other one good idea is to install and run this application from a
virtual environment, but you should know already to do that...)

## RUN

move back to the directory of the project and start:

```bash
cd ..
python OC-openFoodFacts
```
